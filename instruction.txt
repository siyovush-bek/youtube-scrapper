1. Create a virtual environment:
--> python3 -m venv env

2. Activate the virtual environment:
--> source env/bin/activate (linux, macOS)
--> source env/Scripts/activate (windows, using git bash)

3. Install dependencies
--> pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Create input file (e.g. input.txt): each line must consist of SEARCH QUERY and NAME for output csv file seperated with a whitespace.
Words in search query must be seperated with '+' symbol
here how it would look like:

ted+talks ted
async+tasks async
fastapi+beginner's+tutorial fastapi

4. Run the script

--> python main.py input.txt


By default script fetches 30 videos from search query, to change this 
you can set env variable MAXRESULTS with your prefered number
just before runing the script do like this

--> export MAXRESULTS=35

and script will fetch over 35 videos
